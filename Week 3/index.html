				  <p>These guys did a great job on my website. I brought some colors and fonts and an idea, and they made my dream come to life!</p>
				  <p>Karen McKlusky | Karens Kountry Kritters</p>
          <p>Without Carter Creative, I would have never gotten my order-over-the-internet cupcake business off of the ground. Thanks so much CCS!</p>
				  <p>Delbert Presse | WebCakes, Inc.</p>
				  <p>After I saw the portfolio that CCS had, I quickly cut my relationship with my old designers, Fencl. At least CCS websites don't all look the same!</p>
